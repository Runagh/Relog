GitHub Pages uses software called “Jekyll” to handle all the fancy stuff behind the scenes. Jekyll is what converts your blog post files into nicely formatted HTML that you can view in the browser. Jekyll is capable of doing a TON of great stuff, but for now, that’s really all you need to know.

Blog post files should always be named using this format: `yyyy-mm-dd-your-blog-post-name.md`

A post written on January 28th, 2021, would be named `2021-01-28-my-blog-post.md`. Be careful not to use future dates because the post won’t show up.

Posts are written in markdown, if you don’t know it, don’t worry, there’s not much to it. See [this post by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to learn some of the basics.
