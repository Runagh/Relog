Okay, I'll admit that I've spent many hours of my life on the internet.  I caught the "www.bug" when I was a teenager and I gained access to a world of creativity that I desperately wanted to be a part of.  That was back when blogs were still weblogs, when winamp was *the* choice for your music and before anyone had a MySpace page.

Despite all those years exploring, meeting people, creating and even falling in love - I'd never really found a place where I felt I could truly express myself.  Until I stumbled upon [Second Life](http://www.secondlife.com).
